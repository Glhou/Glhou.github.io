Nowadays, cities are congested and have a lot of vehicles, 95 percent of the time these vehicles are not even used according to Standing still study. There is different ways to reduce the amount of vehicles in a city but this research plan to focus on carpooling. This method of transportation has existed for a long time and used to be less popular as people prefer the private space of their own car. But recently it started to become popular again with Uber and other applications. The result is that most of the cars driven every days have only one person inside of it. Buses might be a solution but they are not dynamic enough, that is why this research focuses on using autonomous taxis instead. They are much smaller and flexible for this kind of use. This study focuses on reducing the number of vehicles while maintaining time efficiency using an enhanced simulated annealing to find the global optimum faster than other solutions. It will be compared to SUMO greedy shared algorithm. This will be done with different load of passengers, using a simple network as a reference and New York open data as more realistic data. As expected global travel time increased by 30% but with small area and few trips to handle simulated annealing reduces the number of vehicles more than 30% of the fleet size from the simple greedy shared algorithm.
